* Synopsis
The purpose of this python script is to bring those of us who chose to use
=command line accounting=, some of the benefits of more conventional accounting
programs, namely the ability to pull our transaction information from supported
institutions via automated means and format them into our preferred text syntax.
Currently, this program supports [[http://ledger-cli.org/][Ledger]] and [[http://furius.ca/beancount/][Beancount]] syntax exports.

To download transactions, we use [[http://www.plaid.com][Plaid]]. This program will help you setup your
accounts and download transactions from the Plaid API. I have tried to make this
as simple as possible to setup.

Also, once downloaded, your transactions will be stored in a Mongo database. It
is actually the transactions pulled from the database that we run though our
syntax renderers. This is required to help keep track of which transaction we
have already processed (as well as have records to reconstruct our files should
the need arise).

The main inspiration for the workings of the export part of the script came from
the excellent [[https://github.com/quentinsf/icsv2ledger][icsv2ledger]]. I borrowed heavily from Quentin's excellent script in
making this tool, and in some places I have shamelessly stolen his code altogether.

* Contributions
Feedback and contributions are encouraged. I hope that this will pick up some
traction in the community, and in the end we can all have a rock-solid program
to help us with our accounting.

* Requirements
- Python           => 3.5
  * PyMango        => 0.1.1
  * prompt_toolkit => 0.57
  * plaid-python   => 1.3.0
- ledger-cli       => 3        (if using ledger syntax)
- Beancount        => 2.0      (if using beancount syntax)
- MongoDB          => 3.2.3

I have only tested this on Linux. I have no desire to run this on Windows, but
feel free to give it a shot, it may work. The same goes for Mac, although
sometime in the future I may test on OSX.

*Note*: python dependencies must be installed prior to running the script. All
can be installed from =pip= or of course whatever means you wish to use.


* Plaid
Plaid is an API used in building web-based financial applications. It provides
access to our transactions at a number of institutions. To get started with this
program, you must sign up for a plaid account. Once you have done that Plaid
will issue you some developer keys to use with their API. 

The keys we are interested in are:
- client_id :: this is your developer ID
- secret :: this is your authentication token

Once you have obtained your keys then use =plaid2text= to create your
configuration file and save your keys into it. You can do this by simply
invoking plaid2text without arguments. =./plaid2text= will prompt you for your
keys and store them in your config file.

A note about Plaid. Plaid is a paid service, but developers have access to the
developer API without paying. The developer API has all the features of the
production API. I have been using this for a few months now on my 6 accounts and
everything is still working just fine. I did contact them about what the cost
would be (and told them my use case), and was informed that a paid version comes
to 0.25 USD per account, per month. That is still a heck-of-a-better deal than
Quickbooks online in my opinion. I can get my 6 accounts for 1.50 USD per month,
but like I mentioned, I have yet run into any caps on my developer account, so
that may be all I ever use.

* Plaid2Text

In order to use =plaid2text= you must have already followed the instructions in
the Plaid section. Once you have your initial config in place, then let's get
started in creating your first account.

** Creating a Plaid Account
In order to get transactions from Plaid, you must create an account. In order to
create an account, you must authenticate yourself to your institution via your
username and password, and also most institutions require some form of multi
factor authentication, usually in the form of security questions, or codes sent
to registered phone/email for the account. Using =plaid2text= this is easy to
accomplish. 

First issue the following command:

=./plaid2text account_nickname --create-account=

As an example let's say I am setting up an account for my personal checking, and the
institution I use is Chase. I might use this command to create it.

=./plaid2text chase_checking --create-account=

This would allow me to setup and account with the nickname =chase_checking=. You
will use the nickname for downloading and parsing transactions, so make
it something meaningful for you.

Once you have issued the above command =plaid2text= will present you with a list of
institutions from which to choose.

#+BEGIN_SRC
What bank is this account going to be for? 
1   Bank of America
2   Chase
3   Wells Fargo
4   Citi
5   US Bank
6   USAA
7   American Express
8   Navy Federal Credit Union
9   SunTrust

Enter Number [q to quit]:
#+END_SRC

In our example we will choose =2= and hit enter. This will take us to the
authorization screen, and will prompt for your credentials and follow up with
the multi factor authentication (if required). If you enter everything correctly
you will have setup your first account in Plaid. The program will then prompt
you for some default config options. Config options are covered in the proceeding
sections.

Note: wait at least 15 minutes before the first download of your transactions,
this give Plaid time to collect the information from your institution. Plaid
says it will have them within 240 seconds, but I think it's better to give it
time. 

Also, different institutions keep your historical data for different
lengths of time. You can check the availability here: [[https://github.com/plaid/support/blob/master/data-availability.md][Data Availability]]

* Arguments Summary

#+BEGIN_SRC
plaid_account: (mandantory) this is the nickname you assigned when creating account
outfile: output filename or stdout in your chosen snytax (ledger,beancount)
#+END_SRC

*Note*: the outfile will be _overwritten_ each time this is run so be careful
that you do not erase your current journal file, or any other file of importance.

* Options Summary
A lot of these options also have an equivalent setting in the config file
(=~/.config/plaid2text/config=). Where this happens, the config file settings
will be underscored versions of the command line long options: =--mappings-file=
would become =mappings_file=. 

Also, note that when there are both config setting and command line options, the
command line options take precedence over config file settings.

** Options

~--accounts-file~ 
is a file that you can store predefined account definitions for Ledger in
the form of =account Expenses:Unknown=. This file is parsed for the account
names and all lines that do not start with *account* will be ignored.

This is *LEDGER* specific setting. 

~--all-transactions~ 
will pull all transactions regardless if they are marked as already pulled.
By default only transactions that have not been pulled to text are returned.

~--clear-screen, -C~
clears the screen before every transaction prompt. Default is ~False~.

~--cleared-character {*,!}~
is the character mark a transactions as cleared or not. Default is =*=

~--create-account~
is used to create a new account. See creating account section above for more.

~--currency STR~
is the currency used for transactions. Default is =USD=.

~--default-expense STR~
is the default account for which to post transactions to. Default
=Expenses:Unknown=

~--download-transactions, -d~
fetches new transactions from Plaid into Mongo for given account.

Use: =./plaid2text acct_nickname -d=

~--from-date STR~
specify a the starting date for transactions to be pulled.

Use in conjunction with ~--to-date~ to specify range 

Date format: =YYYY-MM-DD= or =YYYY/MM/DD=

~--headers-file FILE~
file which contains contents to be written to the top of the output file. For
example, I store my beancount files as OrgMode files, so I have my headers file
setup to insert instructions at the top for =Emacs=, to help ease my editing of
them once they are exported to text. And also I include my main beancount file
which has all my accounts listed, this also allows for easy running of
=bean-check= to verify the newly exported file.

#+BEGIN_SRC
;; -*- mode: org; mode: beancount; -*-  
include "/path/to/somewhere/main.beancount"
#+END_SRC

Default: =~/.config/plaid2text/headers=

~--journal-file FILE, -j FILE~
journal file where to read payees/accounts. This could be your main ledger file
or your main beancount file. 

Tip: you can use includes to pull in your other journal files

Default journal file: =~/.config/plaid2text/journal=

~--mapping-file FILE~
file which holds the mappings for matching transactions to accounts/payees as
well as some default tags, if you want.

You can have a separate mappings file per account.

default: =~/.config/plaid2text/mapping=

~--mongo-db STR~
name of the Mongo database that stores downloaded transactions.

Default: ~plaid2text~

~--no-mark-processed, -n~
will not mark pulled transactions as pulled. When passed, the pulled transactions will still be listed as new
transactions upon the next run. 

Default: ~False~

~--output-date-format STR~
date format for output file 

Default: ~YYYY/MM/DD~

~--output-format {beancount,ledger}, -o {beancount,ledger}~
what syntax to use for the output file. 

Default output format: beancount

~--posting-account STR, -a STR~
posting account used as source 

Default: ~Assets:Bank:Checking~

~--quiet, -q~
do not prompt if account can be deduced from mappings

Default: ~False~

~--tags, -t~
causes the program to prompt for transaction tags 

Default: ~False~

~--template-file FILE~  
file which holds the text template used in the output file for formatting transactions.

Default: =~/.config/plaid2text/template=

~--to-date STR~
specify the ending date for transactions to be pulled. 

use in conjunction with ~--from-date~ to specify range

Date format: ~YYYY-MM-DD~ or ~YYYY/MM/DD~

* Example Uses
  
The following will set up a new account with nickname =chase_checking=

~./plaid2text chase_checking --create-account~

The following will download all new transactions for the account
=chase_checking=. 

    *NOTE*: when downloading for the first time, be sure to wait at least 30min
    after setting up the account. This gives Plaid time to pull your
    transactions from the institution.

~./plaid2text chase_checking --downlad-transactions~

The following will pull all new  transactions for account
=chase_checking= and output them to =/tmp/onetime.ldg= Ledger syntax
after prompting you for the correct information for every transaction and
marking all pulled transaction in the database as pulled.

~./plaid2text chase_checking /tmp/onetime.ldg --output-format ledger~

The following will pull *all* transactions starting from the given date for the
=chase_checking= account and will not mark them as pulled in the database, and
will output beancount syntax to stdout.

~./plaid2text chase_checking --all-transactions --from-date 2015/04/15 --no-mark-processed~

* Processing a Transaction
When you start processing transactions, you will be presented with
several prompts related to the current transaction. These prompts will be to
get the associated account, the payee, and optionally tags. If you have a
mappings file, provided a journal file, or have already processed a few
transactions, then ~TAB~ completion is available at all these prompts.

During your first run, when your mappings file has not yet been established, you
will have to manually (via prompts) establish the correct accounts and payees.
But once you have done so, your mappings file will have the correct information
for transactions in the future, and given that most of us are creatures of habit
and make purchases from the same places, you will only occasionally have to
account for new entries. 

Now let's walk through a transaction for you can get an idea of what to expect.
Keeping with out sample account =chase_checking=, we will pull the latest
transactions, and also prompt for tags (=--tags=) and suppress prompting for
known transactions via our mappings (=--quiet=), we will also be using
=beancount= output syntax (=--output-format=).

~./plaid2text chase_checking /tmp/onetime.bnc --quiet --tags --output-format beancount~

When the above command is run, you will be presented with a prompt for the first
non-matched transaction. The first prompt is for the payee. You will notice that
the default answers are in =[]=, so if you just hit enter, that will be the
value. When looking at the transaction prompt, you will see it starts with a
date followed by the name that Plaid assigns this transaction, in this case
Plaid got it correct, this will not always be the case. The next area shows the
amount of the transaction.

[[file:img/netflix_payee.png]]

Following the payee prompt is the "Account" prompt. Enter the correct associated
account, then hit enter.

[[file:img/netflix_account.png]]

Then we are prompted for tags (because we passed ~--tags~). Tags work a little
differently, you will be prompted over and over for tags until you just hit
enter without typing another value. If you make a mistake in entering your tag,
you may prefix the tag with =-= (minus) to remove it. For instance say you
accidentally typed =mvoie= and hit enter, when the prompt comes back you see
your mistake in the default area and want to correct it. So now you type
=-mvoie= and hit enter, and you will notice that the tag has been removed.

[[file:img/netflix_tags.png]]

When you hit enter the final time on tags, the program will move on to the next
transaction needing your input.

Again, all of these prompts use =TAB= completion, and the more information you
give the program, via your config files, the better the completion becomes.


* Configuration Files
** Main Configuration File
This is an example config file that has an account setup that is nicknamed
=chase_checking=. You will notice some settings that are obfuscated with xxx,
these are created when setting up accounts, and are not entered manually.

#+BEGIN_SRC
    [DEFAULT]
    posting_account = Assets:Bank:Checking
    default_expense = Expenses:Unknown
    encoding = utf-8
    currency = USD
    mongo_db = plaid2text
    quiet = False
    tags = False
    output_date_format = %%Y/%%m/%%d
    clear_screen = False
    cleared_character = *
    output_format = beancount

    [PLAID]
    client_id = xxxxxxxa66710877xxxxxxxx
    secret = xxxxxxxxx8c9a0cd27xxxxxxxxxxxx

    [chase_checking]
    access_token = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxdf0fbb4cc4f5323f7ccd6
    account = xxxxxxxxxxxxxPzJ3nAkFxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    currency = USD
    posting_account = Assets:Bank:Chase:Checking
    mapping_file = ~/.config/plaid2text/chase_checking/mapping_bc
    headers_file = ~/.config/plaid2text/chase_checking/headers_bc
    accounts_file = ~/somewhere/main.beancount
    journal_file = ~/somewhere/beancount/main.beancount
    template_file = ~/.config/plaid2text/chase_checking/template_bc
#+END_SRC
 
** Template File
The template file is what transforms your transactions into the desired text
based accounting syntax. You have access to all the fields that plaid returns to
use in your templates. But be aware that not all fields are returned with every
transaction, and you might have to modify the source to handle this, should you
choose to use them in your template. Below is a list of all fields available.
The =A= column indicates if field is always available. 

| Field                         | Types   | A |
|-------------------------------+---------+---|
| _account                      | String  | y |

| meta.payee                    | String  | n |
| meta.payment_method           | String  | n |
|-------------------------------+---------+---|

In addition to the above fields =plaid2text= also provides the following:

| Field               | type   |
|---------------------+--------|
| posting_account     | String |
| associated_accounts | String |
| payee               | String |
| tags                | String |
|---------------------+--------|

*** Brief Field Description (only of main use fields)
- _account :: the Plaid account ID
- _id :: the Plaid transaction ID, Also the MongoDB ~_id~
-  name :: the Plaid name for the transaction. (i.e. Best Buy)
- amount :: the amount of debit/credit. This is a *signed* number.
- date :: the date the transaction occurred
- posting_account :: the account transaction are posted to
- associated_account :: the expense or other account attributed to the transaction
- payee :: the payee for the transaction
- tags :: the given tags for the transaction in a string
  - beancount :: format '#tag1 #tag2 #etc'
  - ledger :: format ':tag1:tag2:etc:'
     

*** Defaults
**** beancount
#+BEGIN_SRC
{transaction_date} {cleared_character} "{payee}" "" {tags}
    plaid_name: {name}
    _id: {_id}
    {associated_account:<60}   {amount} {currency}
    {posting_account:<60}
#+END_SRC
**** ledger
#+BEGIN_SRC
{transaction_date} {cleared_character} {payee} {tags}
    ; plaid_name: {name}
    ; _id: {_id}
    {associated_account:<60}   {currency} {amount}
    {posting_account:<60}
#+END_SRC

** Headers File

The headers file is used to add some text to the top of the output file. This
can be anything you like. I use mine for adding some header info for =Emacs= to
read for it sets the correct mode for me when I edit the file.

I also use the ~include~ directive to pull in my main file, to aide in running =bean-check=.

** Mappings File
The mappings file is simply a =CSV= formatted file, that contains four fields. When
exporting transactions, this file will try to establish the proper accounts and
payees for each transaction based on the fields in the file. It also handles
adding some default tags.

This file is created for you, if you do not have one defined in the settings.
Also, it is appended to every time you are exporting transactions with the new
matches, that way next time you export you will not have to enter the
information again if you use =--quiet=.

*** Fields
1. text to match against the Plaid =name= field. This can be either plain text
   or a regex. If the field starts and ends with =/= it is assumed to be a
   regex. Note: all the regexes will be matched /case insensitive/.
2. the name you wish to use for the =payee=
3. the associated expense or other account (i.e. ~Expenses:Unknown~)
4. tags to be used for this transaction. This should be in the form of a string.
   For ledger the format would be: ~:tag1:tag2:etc:~ and for beancount: ~#tag1 #tag2 #etc~

*** Important Point
The matching algorithm will always use the latest match when processing entries.
So if for example you have a regex setup that matches //best buy// at the top of
the mappings file and another that has //buy// later in the file, the last match
wins.

*** Sample Mappings File
Some of the listings will contain ledger formatted tags while other will be
beancount, you of course will only have the type that you need, do not mix them.

#+BEGIN_SRC
/Amazon/,"Amazon",Expenses:Unknown:Amazon, #sort-out
/PAYPAL INST XFER/,"PayPal",Expenses:Unknown:PayPal, :sort-out:
/.*NETFLIX.*/,"Netflix",Expenses:Bills:Subscriptions:Netflix
/.*DROPBOX.*/,"Dropbox",Expenses:Bills:Subscriptions:Dropbox
/Amazon Video/,"Amazon Video",Expenses:Entertainment:Movies
The Doughnut Palace,"The Doughnut Palace",Expenses:Food:FastFood
54th Street,"54th Street",Expenses:Food:Restaurant
BJ'S RESTAURANTS,"BJ's Restaurant",Expenses:Food:Restaurant
#+END_SRC

Also notice the sorting of the entries so that =Amazon Video= gets categorized
properly. If it were above the =Amazon= entry, it would use the setting from
there instead, as the last entry always wins.


* Workflow
In this section I will just describe my basic workflow to demonstrate how I use
this tool. Going forwards assumes you have already established your plaid setup
as well as at least one account. I will continue to demonstrate with the example
account =chase_checking= to keep things consistent.

** Download New Transactions
When I get ready to work on my books, I start by downloading the newest
transactions for the account I am working on. 

~./plaid2text chase_checking -d~

This will download all the newest transactions from my accounts into the MongoDB.

      You can of course setup a cron job to do this nightly, but I find it fits
      into my workflow just doing it manually.

** Export New Transactions
I export new transaction (all the ones that haven't previously been pulled), into
a temporary file, where I can do some manual checking and editing.

~./plaid2text chase_checking /tmp/onetime.beancount --quiet~

Using the =--quiet= switch, the program will only prompt me for information on
the transactions that it cannot deduce based on the mappings file. You can of
course leave that switch off if you want to be able to change the defaults from
the mapping file.

Also, if you want to do a test run, without marking the transactions as pulled
use the =--no-mark-pulled= switch.

*IMPORTANT* I want to stress that the outfile is *OVERWRITTEN* or created
every time this command is run. So be careful. :)

** Copy Transactions
When I am satisfied that all is well with my temp file. I copy the new entries
into my actual journal file.

* DISCLAIMER
This should be considered /*beta*/ version code. I have released it hoping that it
will be of benefit to others in a similar situation as me. This version of the
code is really hacked together and in need of serious refactoring, and will most
likely contain bugs. I have had this working for myself for a few weeks, and
have found it stable and usable. But I do caution you, to use at your own risk.
